            Baked potato rounds are topped with bacon and cheese. Great
            appetizer - a lot like potato skins but easier to make!

            <li>2 large baking potatoes</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>

            <li>
              Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover.
              Bring to a boil, and cook until tender when pierced with a fork,
              about 20 minutes. Drain, and cool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease
              a baking sheet. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high
              heat until crisp. Drain, cool, and crumble.
            </li>
            <li>
              Slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch rounds, and arrange them in a
              single layer on the baking sheet. Sprinkle a few crumbles of bacon
              onto each round, then top with some shredded Cheddar cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is
              melted and lightly browned.
            </li>
