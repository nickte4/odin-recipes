    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Baked potato roudns are topped with bacon and cheese. Great appetizer - a
      lot like potato skins but easier to make!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large baking potatoes</li>
      <li>6 slices bacon</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a
        boil, and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes.
        Drain, and cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        baking sheet. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until
        crisp. Drain, cool, and crumble.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch rounds, and arrange them in a single
        layer on the baking sheet. Sprinkle a few crumbles of bacon onto each
        round, then top with some shredded Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and
        lightly browned.
      </li>
    </ol>
